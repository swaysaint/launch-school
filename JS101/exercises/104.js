// MADLIBS REVISITED
//
// Let's build another program using madlibs. We made a similar program in the
// Easy exercises, but this time the requirements are a bit different.
//
// Build a madlibs program that takes a text "template" as input, plugs in a
// selection of randomized nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into that text,
// and then returns it. You can build your list of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and
// adverbs directly into your program.
//
// The challenge of this program isn't just about writing your solution--it's
// about choosing the structure of the text templates. Choose the right way to
// structure your templates and this problem becomes much easier. Consequently,
// this exercise is a bit more open-ended since the input is also something that
// you'll define for yourself.

// I wrote naughty things in this so not uploading ;)
